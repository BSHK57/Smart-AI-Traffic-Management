## Objectives

- Optimize **traffic flow** using real-time data and predictive models.
- Reduce **congestion** and improve **commute efficiency**.
- Enhance **urban safety** by analyzing camera feeds and sensor data.
- Provide a **dashboard for authorities** to monitor and make informed decisions.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real-time Traffic Prediction** using AI/ML models.
- **Accident Detection** using computer vision .
- **Smart Routing Suggestions** based on congestion level.
- **Data Dashboard** for authorities with analytics and alerts.
